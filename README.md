# Kavindu Dashboard

Quick demonstration of a basic [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) app showing common widgets, charts, and metrics for the Kavindu experience.

## Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy
```

## Run

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open the URL displayed in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501) to interact with the dashboard.
